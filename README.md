> The target company and each committing party should be considered as making separate and joint representations, warranties, and covenants to the investors on the delivery date. All terms guaranteed by the target company and each committing party will be truthful and accurate in all material respects, just as they are guaranteed on the delivery date. However, representations, warranties, and covenants that relate to specific time points and that are only valid or effective at that specific time point, and are true and accurate only at that time point, need only be true and accurate at that time point due to their nature.

> **Question:**
> 
> I would like you to be an experienced legal researcher. I will give you a topic and you will return me a list of 5 relevant cases for slegal argument on this topic with bluebook citations. My topic is gay marriage.

> **Answer:**
> 
> Certainly! Here are five relevant cases on gay marriage with their Bluebook citations:
> 1. Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___ (2015). This landmark case declared same-sex marriage as a constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
> 2. Windsor v. United States, 570 U.S. 744 (2013). This case struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, as unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.
> 3. Perry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2012). This case affirmed the unconstitutionality of California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
> 4. Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 440 Mass. 309 (2003). This case made Massachusetts the first state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage, holding that the state's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Massachusetts Constitution.
> 5. Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health, 289 Conn. 135 (2008). This case made Connecticut the third state to legalize same-sex marriage, holding that the state's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Connecticut Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process.
