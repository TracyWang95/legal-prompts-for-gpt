Keep the meaning the same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply to me with the correction, the improvements, and nothing else, do not write explanations.

> Answer:

> Certainly! Here are five relevant cases on gay marriage with their Bluebook citations:

> 2. Windsor v. United States, 570 U.S. 744 (2013). This case struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, as unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.
> 3. Perry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2012). This case affirmed the unconstitutionality of California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
> 4. Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 440 Mass. 309 (2003). This case made Massachusetts the first state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage, holding that the state's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Massachusetts Constitution.
> 5. Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health, 289 Conn. 135 (2008). This case made Connecticut the third state to legalize same-sex marriage, holding that the state's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Connecticut Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process.
