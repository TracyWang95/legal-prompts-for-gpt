> The target company and each committing party should be considered as making separate and joint representations, warranties, and covenants to the investors on the delivery date. All terms guaranteed by the target company and each committing party will be truthful and accurate in all material respects, just as they are guaranteed on the delivery date. However, representations, warranties, and covenants that relate to specific time points and that are only valid or effective at that specific time point, and are true and accurate only at that time point, need only be true and accurate at that time point due to their nature.

> I would like you to act as an experienced legal counsel. What information would you need to know to write a sales of goods contract covering UCC warranty in the state of Indiana?

> **Answer:**
> 
> As an experienced legal counsel, to write a sales of goods contract covering UCC warranty in the state of Indiana, I would need to know the following information:
>
> 1. The names and addresses of the buyer and seller
> 2. A detailed description of the goods being sold
> 3. The price of the goods and the payment terms
> 4. The delivery terms, including the time and place of delivery
> 5. The UCC warranty provisions that will be included in the contract
> 6. The specific warranties that the seller is making regarding the goods
> 7. Any disclaimers of warranties or limitations of liability that will be included in the contract
> 8. The remedies that are available to the buyer in case of breach of warranty or other breaches of the contract
> 9. Any additional terms and conditions that the parties wish to include in the contract
> 
> In addition to the above information, it would also be helpful to know any other relevant facts about the transaction, such as whether the goods are new or used, whether they are custom-made or off-the-shelf, and whether the parties have any prior relationship or history of dealing with each other. This information will help ensure that the sales of goods contract is tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the parties and is enforceable under Indiana law.

> **Question:**
> 
> I would like you to be an experienced legal researcher. I will give you a topic and you will return me a list of 5 relevant cases for slegal argument on this topic with bluebook citations. My topic is same-sex marriage.

> **Answer:**
> 
> Certainly! Here are five relevant cases on same-sex marriage with their Bluebook citations:
> 1. Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___ (2015). This landmark case declared same-sex marriage as a constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
> 2. Windsor v. United States, 570 U.S. 744 (2013). This case struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, as unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.
> 3. Perry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2012). This case affirmed the unconstitutionality of California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
> 4. Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 440 Mass. 309 (2003). This case made Massachusetts the first state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage, holding that the state's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Massachusetts Constitution.
> 5. Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health, 289 Conn. 135 (2008). This case made Connecticut the third state to legalize same-sex marriage, holding that the state's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Connecticut Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process.
